# Landing Page Project

This is my solution to the first assignment in the Web Development Professional course offered by Udacity and FWD.

The starter code has been offered by [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page).

This repository is hosted on github pages at https://nouraneelwazane.github.io/udacity-web-development-professional/landing-page/index.html

## Code Description

This code builds a sections' navbar dynamically.

The navbar items share an on-click event that scrolls the user to the section corresponding to the clicked navbar menu item. The section is given a darker background (.your-active-class css) and the navbar menu item changes its background from white to black (.viewing css).

While scrolling through the page, the section appearing on the window is set as active (gets a darker background) and the corresponding navbar menu item changes its background from white to black.
