# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This an asynchronous Web app that uses the web api provided by openweathermap.org and user entry (USA zip code & user feeling) to dynamically update the UI. This is my solution to an assignment in the FWD/Udacity Web Development Professional. The starter code was provided by [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/weather-journal-app).

## Instructions
To run this code, you'll need the following commands in the terminal:
- npm install express
- npm install cors
- npm install body-parser
- node server.js

Then go to http://localhost:8080/
